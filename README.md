# BaFTAreprodCode
Reproducibility code for BaSTA analysis in Colchero (2025)

Here I provide code, data and a tutorial showing how to reproduce the analyses in Colchero (2025). The repository includes three directories:

- **code**: with four R scripts, *SimulateIndividSimp.R* and *SimulateIndivExt.R* to simulate individual level data for discrete ages and continuous ages with variable IBI, *TestingBaFTAextraFunctions.R* that contains additional functions for the simulations, and *TestingBaFTAsimData.R* with the code to test the package BaFTA on the simulated data.
- **data**: with .RData files with simulated data for slow and fast species.
- **docs**: with the file ***BaFTAvignette.pdf*** with a step by step tutorial explaining how to use the R package BaFTA.
